So, what is it...?

# First of all, what is a `zero-sum game` (`zsg`)...?

> A zero-sum game is a situation where, if one party loses, the other party wins, and the net change in wealth is zero.

- *Gambling* is a `zsg`, you earn $1 if our opponent looses $1, no money was made.
- A *League of Legends* match is a `zsg`, you either win or lose, and there is no in-between.
- *Stock trading* is a `zsg`, you buy it high, another one sells it low, and not everyone is making money, really.
- Chess, football, racing, *tic-tac-toe*,... anything that requires a loser to create a winner - is a `zsg`.
- The *Cold War* - everyone prepared everything to scare the others - nothing happened in the end, if the US create a better bomb, the Soviet Union is considered lost.

It's everywhere around me, and I kinda accept the fact that it's the only kind of game that exists.

Well at first I found it quite challenging to imagine `nzsg` in real life.

After all, how can everyone wins?
Doesn't that mean no one won...?

- *Gambling* is an `nzsg` if it becomes your career, you learn from it, plan for it, and work for the money you win.
After all, each game you play may make you a better player.
- Same story for *League of Legends*, or chess, football, racing, *tic-tac-toe*,...
- Stock trading is NOT an `nzsg`, but stock investing is - by putting your money consistently on a company, you benefit from the company's growth in productivity.
- Well, the *Cold War* is still a pretty giant `zero-sum game`.
