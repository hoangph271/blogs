So, what is it...?

# First of all, what is a `zero-sum game` (`zsg`)...?

> A zero-sum game is a situation where, if one party loses, the other party wins, and the net change in wealth is zero.

- *Gambling* is a `zsg`, you earn $1 if your opponent loses $1, and no money was made.

- A *League of Legends* match is a `zsg`, you either win or lose, and there is no in-between.

- *Stock trading* is a `zsg`, you buy it high, another one sells it low, and not everyone is making money, really.

- Chess, football, racing, *tic-tac-toe*,... anything that requires a loser to create a winner - is a `zsg`.

- The *Cold War* - everyone prepared everything to scare the others - nothing happened in the end, if the US create a better bomb, the Soviet Union is considered lost.

It's everywhere around me, and I kinda accept the fact that it's the only kind of game that exists.

Well at first I found it quite challenging to imagine `nzsg` in real life.

After all, how can everyone win?
Doesn't that mean no one won...?

- *Gambling* is an `nzsg` if it becomes your career, you learn from it, plan for it, and work for the money you win.  
After all, each game you play may make you a better player.

- Same story for *League of Legends*, or chess, football, racing, *tic-tac-toe*,...

- Stock trading is NOT an `nzsg`, but stock investing is - by putting your money consistently on a company, you benefit from the company's growth in productivity.

- Well, the Cold War is still a pretty giant zero-sum game, but if you consider its effect on history, it caused so many shifts in the evolution of mankind, in our cultures, technology, our values, and it at least taught our leaders a big lesson (or maybe it didn’t).

I find this concept pretty interesting, pretty much all of the examples above convince me that:

> `nzsg` can be anything if you consider the long-term effect it has on all of us, how can you extract the value to benefit our life?
