## 05/06/2022  - The next big YouTube channel...!

So, here's the idea...!  
You like to know JavaScript, and you should be talking in English more, right...?

> And so do I...!  
> Sooooo...!

We could...!

- Create a YouTube/Twitch channel
- START recording
- Follow the MDN tutorials and learn JavaScript together
- Only speak English
- END recording
- Repeat every week
- Pick a project, keep learning & building


```
`I` - could be any coder...!
`You` - could be any non-coder...!
```
