### Non zero-sum games

> I learned it from the movie - [*Arrival (2016)...!*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/)

So, what are those...?

# First of all, what is a `zero-sum game` (`zsg`)...?

> A zero-sum game is a situation where, if one party loses, the other party wins, and the net change in wealth is zero.

- *Gambling* is a `zsg`, you earn $1 if our opponent looses $1, no money was made...!
- A *League of Legends* match is a `zsg`, you either win or loose, there is no in-between...!
- `Trading` is a `zsg`, you buy it high, another one sell it low, not everyone is making money, really...!

- Chess, football, racing, `tick-tack-toe`,... anything that requires a loser to create a winner - is a `zsg`...!
- The *Cold War*...!

It's evevy where around me, and I kinda accept the fact that it's the only kind of game that exists...!

> it *requires a loser to create a winner*...!

# So, what is a `non-zero-sum game` (`nzsg`)...?

Well at first I found it quite difficult to imagine `nzsg` in real life...?
